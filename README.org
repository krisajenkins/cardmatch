* Card Match Capes

A little web game written in Elm (with some
Haskell). [[http://krisajenkins.github.io/cardmatch][Try it out]].


** Building

Still very much a work-in-progress, but if you have stack & elm
installed, you can try it out if you wish:

*** Build the UI
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
( cd ui ; make )
#+END_SRC

*** Build the server
Edit =src/Keys.hs=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stack install
sphere -d | tee products.json
sphere -w
#+END_SRC
